            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Not another stock tip!</h2>
                <p>How do you find which stocks to invest and when to invest in? You know the pain of finding the right stock to commit your money in? Don't you? And the horrors of entering at the wrong time or waiting too long and missing the move.</p>
                <p>We feel you… there are around 7000 of them to pick from and around 250 trading sessions to make a position in them.</p>
                <p>So, most of us turn to stock tips, primarily from friends who they believe know the market (you know the reality, they just know where Nifty is around) or to news channels (let’s not even get started with what agendas these guys have), Or the stars and the experts and gurus of market experts on whose whims Banknifty moves a good 500 points (:P).</p>
                <p>See, we are just a couple of guys who just can’t trust experts. Knowing the market is zero sum (at least the FnO) we have a strong gut feeling that it is rigged. Market isn’t following the news rather news follows the market. And the tips and news are not for charity but these guys have a bigger fish to fry.</p>
                <p>We even won’t trust the gentleman showing his verified PNL and how good his star picks were. We will trust if we are reasoned with on why something will work. But no one does that as it’s a sure shot way to lose the edge you have.</p>
                <p>We know the pain of finding that stock that can buy us the Bungalow in the high park street. We also know the pain of having the right stock but missing the right time that turns the dreamland to misery.</p>
                <blockquote>“Stock is right if it moves”. Buy it at a 52 week low if you are that value seeking guy or at a 52 week high if you are the momentum rider, but at the end of the day it is right if it moves.</blockquote>
                <p>So we designed a method to give some sanity among the madness and we believe if you follow it with keen (give it a few minutes) for a couple of weeks you will realize. It's actually simple.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="about-us">
                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>A couple of nobodies! We have very little experience of 5 years in the stock market with over 100s of experiments in trading and investing and building automated systems. Some resulted in gains and many in losses. What we learnt was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Experts are clueless if the market will move up, down or in circles. You know the monkey experiment where monkeys picked better stocks than fund managers in the long run.</li>
                    <li>Many experts have been seen to lie boldly. They show a selective portfolio and also smile unnecessarily. (this hurts a lot, that stupid “I know better than you smile”)</li>
                    <li>Everyone can have their own trading/investing style/system.</li>
                    <li>Past profits are not necessarily reflective to the future.</li>
                    <li>Market prediction is futile - because it’s not random, it’s deliberately made random.</li>
                    <li>Minimizing risk for retail investors is more important than earning huge profits.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="the-method">
                <h2>The Method!</h2>
                <p>As you would have guessed by now that this report is to help a trading system which is personally suited for you. If you have a job or business and can spend a little time growing your hard-earned cash.</p>
                <p>The results are based on an automated scan. The scan is nothing new and is publicly available. Following are the criteria for the scan:</p>
                <blockquote>“We want movement in stocks, remember “Stock is right if it moves”. This can be identified with momentum but we don’t want to enter when everyone in the village including your neighbor’s dog has finished entering. Something that has recently started moving more than the markets. Large volumes after a long silence is one sign and other signs are pattern breakouts.”</blockquote>
                <p>This report narrows down stocks from scans and lists them in a page with additional information, so that you don’t have to manually look through all the stocks and identify them. It does the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Collect all data from the market from the time they have existed.</li>
                    <li>Run the scan based on volume and other things to narrow them down.</li>
                    <li>Count the number of such pop ups in the previous 20 days.</li>
                    <li>Count the number of such pop ups in the previous 9 months.</li>
                    <li>Collate all results in a one page with following information:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analysts ratings and number of analysts from yahoo.</li>
                        <li>Industry and a brief about stock.</li>
                        <li>A full blown interactive chart of the stock to quickly skim through if any patterns are visible or likable.</li>
                        <li>Screener and google stocks link for further fundamental analysis like cash flow, revenue, latest news etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>All the above in a single page so that with a single scroll what looks good can be quickly investigated further and decided upon.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Even if there is weekly one to two new stocks that you want to invest in, your portfolio grows in a year from 50 to 100 stocks and thus reduces risk; it greatly diversifies your portfolio. This way it takes around half an hour a week to keep up with the stocks that matter for us and make decisions based on that.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="limitations">
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not vouch for any stock here as we are not experts. If you don’t trust anyone else when it comes to investing your money then this is a good report to spend 30 mins of your weekend afternoon. And it comes free…</li>
                    <li>We do not claim that we have made xx profits and that’s why you should trust us, rather we say these are some 100 narrowed down stocks and you can quickly eyeball this to find if you see a gem in it. How is it narrowed down - it’s simple, whichever has seen a huge bump in their volumes recently. That’s it! It encapsulates all other technical indicators for us, even the breakouts that matter. Think about it!</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t provide any exit or target to any of the stocks, you may see them for some stocks but we don’t trust them and they come again from yahoo stocks.</li>
                    <li>It doesn’t provide any predictions of the future as it can’t be predicted. Rather it’s to decide where you should put your money today.</li>
                    <li>The method is semi - automatic because looking at fundamental factors is pretty subjective, also everyone has different investing/trading style, how it is to be used is up to you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are like us and do not belive on profit screenshots and bragged P&L statements of influencers, let's embark on a journey where we can grow by learning and teaching ourselves.</p>
                <!--p>We include one quick backtest results below on but then the market was also good then. The Y axis is return and x axis when the reports would have popped stocks and none of them are manually filtered, rather all stocks are shown:</p-->
                <!--div class="backtest-placeholder">
